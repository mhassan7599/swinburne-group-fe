            <h2>WHO ARE WE</h2>
            <p>
              When it comes to renewing your current lease, often the property manager would issue you an offer to renew your lease or exercise your option to renew, with a higher rental structure but
              without a higher/market incentive. Again, this would be the standard paradigm for the landlord’s best interest.
            </p>
            <p>
              Nine out of ten tenants would agree to the proposal without considering the situation of the building or centre they are in. Imagine this, if the building has large vacancy or the
              surrounding market carry higher vacancy rates, this would mean that the landlord would be keen to retain its tenants.
            </p>
            <p>Know that, financials or rent & incentive, are the most easy terms to be agreed upon – however determination of them will require knowledge & expertise.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="who-we-list inner-list">
            <h2>Here is a few aspects that a tenant will unlikely to consider when renew their lease:</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <h4>Existing Lease Conditions:</h4>
                Your current lease may have some onerous conditions or hefty make good conditions and when you renew your lease, this would be an opportunity when you can renegotiate these terms. Same
                way, you can also include additional conditions to your favour, i.e. break clause or assignment conditions, etc. when renegotiate your current lease.
              </li>
              <li>
                <h4>Amenities:</h4>
                One of the key areas where most of the tenants complain about is the amenities of the building or centre. If the standard of the amenities isn’t to your satisfaction, this is an
                opportunity to address this issue.
              </li>
              <li>
                <h4>Vacancy Rates:</h4>
                It’s paramount that you’re across the vacancy of the building or the centre as well as the area that you are in, this will factor greatly in your new rent and incentive offering. If
                the vacancy rate is high in your current building/centre, this will mean that the landlord would be keen to retain you.
              </li>
              <li>
                <h4>Market Incentive:</h4>
                You can only negotiate the market incentive once you’re aware of the market incentive rate. At Swinburne Property, we are extremely passionate about the industry and constantly
                monitoring leasing transactions that are taking place in the market and this way, we would be able to advise you the best outcome.
              </li>
              <li>
                <h4>Notable Renewals:</h4>
                We will advise you the recent relevant/comparable renewals took place within the vicinity of your building/centre. This information would become point of market evidence.
              </li>
              <li>
                <h4>Surrounding Demographic:</h4>
                It’s crucial to know what is happening surrounding your building/centre in the next three to five years before you renew for additional terms. Subject to the type of your business,
                sometimes an unknown futuristic plan may cause serious impact on your business – we are here to future-proof your business!
